We're sharing LADOT's GIS data on bikeways in the city of Los Angeles.

The LADOT maintains such data and [updates it online as a Google map](http://bicyclela.org/maps_main.htm). However, the agency does not share the GIS data. We wanted to share the shapefile we received from the agency, which is current as of April 1, 2015.

We also [published a map using Metro's data](http://www.scpr.org/news/2015/04/03/50740/bicyclists-still-can-t-cross-la-on-marked-bike-lan/), which has the advantage of breaking the bikeways down into three different classes. (The data we received from the LADOT doesn't do that.) The drawback is that the most recent data is from 2012. [You can download that on their website](http://developer.metro.net/introduction/bikeways-data/download-bikeways-data/).

This is the breakdown of bike classes, per Metro's Dave Sotero:
- Class 1—off-street paved bike path
- Class 2 – On-street striped bike lane
- Class 3 – On-street bike route (signge only)
- Cycle Track – On-street Separated Bike Lane


Here's what it looks like if you map it across the city:

Here's what the original Metro map looked like. This doesn't include all bikeways, only class 2 and 3 are represented here, because we were trying to hem to [the methodology used by the Washington Post's Wonkblog](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/04/01/bleak-maps-of-how-cities-look-using-only-their-bike-lanes/). Here's what theat looked like when we did it:
