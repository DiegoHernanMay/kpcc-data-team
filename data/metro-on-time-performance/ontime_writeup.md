In a hurry to get downtown from Hollywood? Hop on the Metro's Red Line trains, which depart from stations on schedule 99.5 percent of the time. Don't mind showing up late? Wait for the 2 bus, which pulls away from stops five minutes late -- or worse -- nearly a quarter of the time.

One-fifth of Metro's buses close their doors late, according to data from the agency covering the last five years. About 5 percent of buses on Metro's 170 bus lines show up early, and more than 75 percent of buses show up on time. But the definition of "on time" may surprise riders: buses can arrive 4 minutes and 59 seconds late and still be considered "on time".

Metro's trains glide into stations on time far more often. Since December 2009, more than 99 percent of trains departed on time. Trains have gotten slightly more late in recent years, as the rail system has undergone rapid expansion, and Metro changed the way it tracks late trains. But in 2014, the data show that 99.3 percent of trains arrived on schedule -- or within 5 minutes of it. (embed graph of rail line lateness)

Some lines are more punctual than others. The Red and Purple Lines zip along underground, only arrivng late once in 200 stops (the lines are tracked together). Those lines run entirely underground and are served by heavy rail trains, unlike the rest of the system.

The light rail Blue Line trains are four times more likely to show up late. About 1 in 50 of them have, the worst performance in the rail system. Metro's Giancarlo Restreppo said that Blue Line trains has more street-grade crossings than other lines, making them more susceptable to street traffic. The 21-mile Blue Line was the first in the county's modern rail system, opening in 1990.

No bus line is as timely as the Metro's trains. Some are punctual, though. The 901 bus rapid transit line--which ferries commuters 20 miles from Chatsworth to North Hollywood in its own dedicated lane--departed from stops within 5 minutes of schedule 94 percent of the time. The 901 is also known as the Orange Line, and it's the only bus route in the system with a dedicated lane. (bus times gif)

On the other side of the specutrum, the 205 bus--which traces 29-mile route along Western, Vermont and Wilmington from San Pedro to Willowbrook--has made it to stops on schedule just 70 percent of the time since August 2010. That's the worst performance of any bus with more than 250,000 stops recorded by the Metro.

Then again, you'd have better luck on the 205 in the summer than in the fall. Over millions of stops tracked in the database, some months emerge as timelier than others for buses.

For example, less than a fifth of all Metro buses were late in July (17.5 percent late) and January (18 percent). But the numbers for October (22.1 percent late) and September (21.9 percent) are considerably worse. 

Restreppo says there's a reason for that. "October and September late rates are seasonally high due to increased ridership as most schools are back in session. During the Summer, ridership decreases. It is easier to adhere to a schedule if there are less patrons." He cites traffic and heavy loads as the biggest challenges in keeping buses running on time.

Here's how some notable routes fare:
* The 460, Metro's longest route, was late 25.4 percent of the time. Its 40 mile route stretches from Downtown Los Angeles to Disneyland.
* The 220, Metro's shortest route, was late 22.5 percent of the time. The line runs along Robertson Blvd. from West Hollywood to Culver City.
* The 720, Metro's most-boarded route, was late 30 percent of the time. The line runs from Santa Monica to Commerce, and is one of the worst-performing routes in the system.
* Two buses zip along the highways in lanes that aren't bus-only. The Silver Line uses express lanes, and stays timely (17.6 percent late). The 577 uses HOV lanes, arriving late 18.7 percent of the time.

Buses have gotten slightly more timely in recent years, according to the data. 20.1 percent of the trips tracked by the the Metro in 2012 were classified as late arrivals. In 2013, that number fell to 19.2 percent and in 2014 it was 19.1 percent. The data tracks millions of stops each year, so a even the 0.1 percent improvement in 2014 meant that buses were on schedule an additional 146,000 times.

The data, provided by the Metro in response to a Public Records Act request, tallies 74,425,377 stops by its buses and trains across Los Angeles County, from December 2011 to November 2014. In recent years, the Metro has outfitted buses with equipment that tracks when and were they open and shut their doors. Each night, that data is downloaded from buses and matched to bus schedules to determine how many departed early, on-time and late. 

The system ignores buses that were more than 20 minutes early or more than an hour late, and the first and last stops are also ignored.

Data collection works differently for rail. When a train arrives more than five minutes late, or is cancelled, an employee at the Rail Operations Control Center makes a record, which eventually gets entered into an electronic database. According to Restreppo, "we may miss logging one or two delays but itâ€™s a rare occurrence." The collection method changed in September 2011, and no longer relies on handwritten notes. 

Restreppo says that the price tag on the Metro's data collection efforts is unknown.

Richard Anderson, who studies transit at Imperial College London, says that some systems have moved towards "passenger dealy metrics", which gauge the impact of transit service for riders. Buses that are late but fairly regular may not incovenice riders, the thinking goes. The Metro doesn't track such metrics, according to Restreppo.

It's difficult to compare the on-time performance of Los Angeles' transit system to others around the country. The Bureau of Transportation Statistics doesn't collect on-time transit performance from transit agencies. Few of those agencies publicize their numbers. And methodlogies and data collection can vary widely from system to system, making them apples-to-oranges comparisons.

About 87 percent of buses arrive to stops on-time in Orange County, according to figures from the Orange County Transportation Authority's. The agency also tracks if buses arrive within five minutes of schedule, but is much smaller than Los Angeles County's Metro, ferrying far fewer passengers on about 100 fewer routes.

The Metro [surveyed other big-city transit systems in 2008](http://media.metro.net/board/Items/2008/06_june/20080618F&BItem18.pdf), and found that its buses were the least punctual of any agency surveyed, which included Chicago, New York and Seattle. Metro's own-time performance improved between 2010 to 2014, according to its own data.
