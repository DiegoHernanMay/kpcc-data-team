===========================

What
====

* Data acquired from the LADWP in 2014. There are three seperate csv files.

	* [```main_leaks_2010_to_partial_2014.csv```](https://github.com/SCPR/kpcc-data-team/blob/master/data/ladwp-water-mains-and-leaks/documented-leaks/main_leaks_2010_to_partial_2014.csv) contains information about leaks.
        * 1 header row + 5,238 records
        * spans Jan. 2010 to Nov. 2014

	* [```REDACTED_CPRA_Mainlines.csv```](https://github.com/SCPR/kpcc-data-team/blob/master/data/ladwp-water-mains-and-leaks/all_mains_trunks/REDACTED_CPRA_Mainlines.csv) contains information about mains in the system
        * 1 header row + 261,501 records

	* And [```REDACTED_CPRA_TrunkLine.csv```](https://github.com/SCPR/kpcc-data-team/blob/master/data/ladwp-water-mains-and-leaks/all_mains_trunks/REDACTED_CPRA_TrunkLine.csv) contains informaiton about trunks in the system.
        * 1 header row + 13,561 records

* ```REDACTED_CPRA_Mainlines.csv``` and ```REDACTED_CPRA_TrunkLine.csv``` were provided with location information redacted. Documentation was provided for the latter two csv files, but not for the leaks csv. Per an LADWP spokeswoman, "pipes larger than 20‚Äù in diameter are considered trunklines. Pipes smaller than that are mainlines."

How Acquired
============

* Leaks csv was provided in response to a records request. The mains and trunks data were provided in response to questions to LADWP about the status of the system's pipes.
