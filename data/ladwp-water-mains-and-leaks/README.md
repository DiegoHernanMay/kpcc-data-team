* **HOW ACQUIRED**:

* **NOTES (12/30/14)**:
    * Garcetti's Earthquake report paints a stark picture of how the city's water infrastructure would fare in an earthquake: "the water system is the utility most vulnerable to earthquake damage, and that damage could be the largest cause of economic disruption following an earthquake"

    * Locally, the DWP's 7,000 miles of pipe are "vulnerable from seismic shaking" from even small earthquakes.

    * The solution: earthquake resistant ductile iron pipes (ERDIP). The problem: we don't have any. LADWP spokesperson says "we don't have a statistically significant amount of earthquake resilient pipe at this time." Building with those would make pipe projects 10-20% more expensive.

    * The pipes we have now are getting old and breaking. Of the breaks in our dataset, here is when the broken pipes were originally installed. Many of them are from the 1920s

    * Below is when all the pipes in the system were installed. Notice that there were big booms of pipe-building the 1920s, and from the 50s through the 70s (the colors here reflect the "likelihood of failure" grade that the DWP gives its pipes. Darker is worse)

    * The majority of pipes are graded C or worse by the LADWP for their "likelihood of failure". C means "medium likelihood of failure"â€”and that doesn't even factor in the risks posed by an earthquake.

    * Finally, our pipes ain't getting any younger. You can see from this graph that several are approaching the end of their "useful life" (as defined by the DWP). The line here is the end of "useful life". Some are past it, and there are many pipes approaching that line:

    * The bottom line is that our pipes would take a big hit in an earthquake, but that they're vulnerable to failures and leaks even without one. The solution posed by the report is to build new, resilient pipes. But we're not building much of anything right now.
